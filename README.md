# finite-logic-immuta-audit
ImmutaAudit prevents subtle, non-deterministic bugs in large, distributed systems by providing cryptographically verifiable integrity checking for complex, nested JavaScript objects. It guarantees deterministic hashing by recursively sorting all object keys, ensuring the same data always produces the same signature, regardless of how  it's created
