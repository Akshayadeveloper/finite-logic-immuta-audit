<b>FINITE LOGIC: ImmutaAudit - Deep Integrity Verifier</b>

ImmutaAudit prevents subtle, non-deterministic bugs in large, distributed systems by providing cryptographically verifiable integrity checking for complex, nested JavaScript objects. It guarantees deterministic hashing by recursively sorting all object keys, ensuring the same data always produces the same signature, regardless of how it was created or processed.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

Standard JavaScript object comparison or JSON stringification is unreliable across microservices or asynchronous operations due to non-deterministic key ordering. ImmutaAudit eliminates this risk by creating an immutable baseline signature, flagging any deep-level side effects or unintended mutations immediately.
